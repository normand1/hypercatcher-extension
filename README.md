# Hypercatcher Extension

The Hypercatcher Extension unifies the chapter creation experience across all major podcasting platforms. Create your podcast chapters using any tool like [studio.hypercatcher.com](https://studio.hypercatcher.com/) to create your chapters and drop them into any supported podcast hosting platform

## Supported Podcast Hosts

This list will grow, but is limited by the hosting platform's chapter creation tools and how easy they are to automate. Please open an issue to request podcast host support or open a PR to add it ðŸ¥·

## How it works

- Create a [Podcasting 2.0 compliant chapters file](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/chapters/jsonChapters.md)
- Drag and drop the chapters file into the Hypercatcher Extension
- Navigate to your supported podcasting host of choice's chapter upload page for your podcast episode
- Click the "Update Chapters" button in the extension to insert your podcast chapters.
